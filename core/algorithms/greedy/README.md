Some commonly-used techniques are:
    Divide and conquer
    Randomized algorithms
    Greedy algorithms (This is not an algorithm, it is a technique.)
    Dynamic programming

What is a 'Greedy algorithm'?
    A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution.
