First In First Out (FIFO)
enqueue, dequeue

- Double-ended queue: characters can be inserted and deleted from both the front and back of the queue.
- Circular queues: In a standard queue, when an element is deleted, the vacant space is not reutilized. However, in a circular queue, vacant spaces are reutilized.
