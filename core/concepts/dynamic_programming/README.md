# Dynamic Programming

`Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.`

The core idea of Dynamic Programming is to avoid repeated work by remembering partial results.

1. Recursion
- Time complexity: O(2^n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

2. Memoize
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)

3. Bottom up
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
